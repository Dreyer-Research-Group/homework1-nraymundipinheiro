    "$b \\gg a,c$ implies $b^2 \\gg ac$. We can assume $b$ is larger enough that $b^2 \\gg 4ac$. This means that $\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}$ will be a number slight smaller than $b$ (let's call it $b_*$). The difference potentially introduces a round-off error, since floating point numbers only store a small number of digits. If $b$ is large enough that it takes most of the available bits, we may lose the precision from $ac$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We end up with $$x = \\frac{-b \\pm b_*}{2a}.$$ Assume $b > 0$. We have to roots: $$x_+ = \\frac{-b + b_*}{2a}$$ and $$x_- = \\frac{-b - b_*}{2a}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider $x_+$ first. Since both $b$ and $b_*$ are large numbers with only a very small difference, we encounter another round-off error. The precision from $ac$ that was lost is propagated onto $b_*$, and it is again propagated here. Since $b$ and $b_*$ are opposite signs, only the round-off errors remain to be divided by $2a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For $x_-$, however, since both numbers add up, we don't have the same problem. We're not going to only depend on the round-off error being left: the error here would be overshadowed by the actual value, given they will be many bits apart."
